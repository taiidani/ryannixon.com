title: Analyst/Programmer IV at the Alaska Department of Public Safety, 2013 - 2014
---

Worked remotely to train my replacement for Analyst/Programmer III and secondary, teaching them the intricacies of the CoTS product I had managed. Lead training sessions twice or more a week while adding technical details on the in-house MediaWiki product that I set up for end-user documentation.

Developed a number of web products including a web-based interface on top of Public Safety's legacy data store using ASP.MVC 4 and Entity Framework 6, as well as a Team Project List to be used as a high-level complement to Asana and Subversion.
