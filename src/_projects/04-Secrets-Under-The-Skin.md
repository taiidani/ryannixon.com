    <p>In March 2011 Jill Flanders Crosby, a UAA faculty member, displayed the result of years of research at the UAA Kimura Gallery. After the gallery opening she decided to represent her work on the UAA website and, through Advancement, worked with UAA Information Technology Services to create the first Faculty Spotlight page that showcases faculty research and accomplishments.</p>
    
    <p>The Secrets Under the Skin website has been specifically made to present Crosby and her collaborator's work in the field. Photography peppers each page, drawing the viewer into the world of Cuba, Havana &amp; other locations. Many images have lightbox functionality attached to them so that one can open a larger version of the image within the page rather than a jarring popup window. In Brian Jeffery and Brandon McElroy's sections a thumbnail gallery of diverse images is present that a viewer can scroll through to enjoy their photography.</p>
