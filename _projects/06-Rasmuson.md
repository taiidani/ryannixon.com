    <p>The Rasmuson Foundation is a non-profit organization that awards approximately $20 million annually to improve the quality of life in Alaska. In 2008 they implemented a new homepage, in-site and administration panel theme that was dramatically improved over the previous interface. Internal PHP site logic was also updated to be faster and more secure and CSS stylesheets were implemented that centered on graceful degradation principles.</p>
