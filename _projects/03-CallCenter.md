    <p>The ITCC Dashboard was created as a platform for IT Services Call Center technicians to quickly respond to support requests. It is set up as an easily extensible web application intended to provide access to multiple account directories from many different types of sources such as LDAP directories and other SQL-based software applications.</p>
    
    <p>The typical usage scenario involves looking up an account through the search interface which sets an Active Object within the application. From there, the technician or other user will take actions upon that Active Object using the provided interface functions or through the application’s modular functionality.</p>
    
    <p>Developers seeking to extend the ITCC Dashboard with new features may use modules to hook in to the application in specific ways. These hooks include entries in the left navigation bar and account buttons/attributes but additional hooks can easily be created with modifications to the core.</p>
