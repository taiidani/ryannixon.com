    <p>The University of Alaska Anchorage refreshed their department-wide content management system theme in January of 2011. The 'DenaliView' theme increases the site width to 960px and dramatically redesigns the interface. Predefined Google searches are now present, a dynamic expandable left navigation is in place, and a new fat footer design makes navigating the large university site substantially easier.</p>
    <p>On the back end of the theme is a new modular design allowing themes to be changed on a per-subsite basis. This modularity has been coupled with ITS' Microsoft SQL Server allowing them to run reports on which subsites of the system have been moved to Denali and which ones have not in addition to performing the switch between subsites at the database level.</p>
