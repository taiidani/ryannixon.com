    <p>Design-PT is both a consulting firm as well as an IT provider. The Mac Pack assists with the monthly maintenance of all Macintosh computers at Design-PT's client sites. It is an application installed on all Design-PT Macs that reports system information such as usage statistics and software update status back to Design-PT. The company then uses this information when going on-site for maintenance to know the state a Macintosh computer is in before they log in.</p>
    <p>When on-site, technicians can trigger a background script on all machines to automatically install system updates and restart. This allows technicians to focus on other site tasks; they only have to verify maintenance has been completed rather than performing the maintenance tasks themselves.</p>
