This is the source for my personal resume website, https://ryannixon.com. It is a simple Hugo static site with a print stylesheet that I can use to generate my resume from.

The only prerequisite for building is Hugo:

```sh
hugo serve
```

Publishing and hosting uses GitHub Actions and Pages, respectively.
