<!--
A little about my work:

I focus on hand coded HTML with preference to HTML5. While I prefer to design for modern web browsers and allow for graceful
degradation of features, I will focus on legacy browsers such as IE6 and IE7 if a target user base may use those browsers...but I think a personal website can thankfully throw out IE7/8 :)

The page source below is indicative of my work. I like valid HTML and organized stylesheets, and typically employ the use of
the jQuery library to enhance my workflow.

						<p>The Alaska Records Management System (ARMS) is an off-the-shelf application meant to take over for the paper-based case reporting procedures that the Alaska State Troopers use. It allows them to track criminal and non-criminal incidents from the moment that they arrive on scene to the point when the case is marked as closed. ARMS also allows them to associate multiple types of entities such as Person records and Property to each incident, and track the incident's lifetime as it moves from officer to officer.</p>

						<p>Due to the structure of ARMS' update functionality, a new system was designed and deployed along with the client. This background Windows service maintains the application and ensures that it is always up to date. It does this by communicating with a WCF web service at the Department of Public Safety which hosts the newest versions and distributes version deltas of them to requesting clients.</p>

						<header></header>
						
						<p>The ITCC Dashboard was created as a platform for IT Services Call Center technicians to quickly respond to support requests. It is set up as an easily extensible web application intended to provide access to multiple account directories from many different types of sources such as LDAP directories and other SQL-based software applications.</p>
						
						<p>The typical usage scenario involves looking up an account through the search interface which sets an Active Object within the application. From there, the technician or other user will take actions upon that Active Object using the provided interface functions or through the application’s modular functionality.</p>
						
						<p>Developers seeking to extend the ITCC Dashboard with new features may use modules to hook in to the application in specific ways. These hooks include entries in the left navigation bar and account buttons/attributes but additional hooks can easily be created with modifications to the core.</p>

						<p>In March 2011 Jill Flanders Crosby, a UAA faculty member, displayed the result of years of research at the UAA Kimura Gallery. After the gallery opening she decided to represent her work on the UAA website and, through Advancement, worked with UAA Information Technology Services to create the first Faculty Spotlight page that showcases faculty research and accomplishments.</p>
						
						<p>The Secrets Under the Skin website has been specifically made to present Crosby and her collaborator's work in the field. Photography peppers each page, drawing the viewer into the world of Cuba, Havana &amp; other locations. Many images have lightbox functionality attached to them so that one can open a larger version of the image within the page rather than a jarring popup window. In Brian Jeffery and Brandon McElroy's sections a thumbnail gallery of diverse images is present that a viewer can scroll through to enjoy their photography.</p>

						<p>The University of Alaska Anchorage refreshed their department-wide content management system theme in January of 2011. The 'DenaliView' theme increases the site width to 960px and dramatically redesigns the interface. Predefined Google searches are now present, a dynamic expandable left navigation is in place, and a new fat footer design makes navigating the large university site substantially easier.</p>
						<p>On the back end of the theme is a new modular design allowing themes to be changed on a per-subsite basis. This modularity has been coupled with ITS' Microsoft SQL Server allowing them to run reports on which subsites of the system have been moved to Denali and which ones have not in addition to performing the switch between subsites at the database level.</p>

						<p>Design-PT is both a consulting firm as well as an IT provider. The Mac Pack assists with the monthly maintenance of all Macintosh computers at Design-PT's client sites. It is an application installed on all Design-PT Macs that reports system information such as usage statistics and software update status back to Design-PT. The company then uses this information when going on-site for maintenance to know the state a Macintosh computer is in before they log in.</p>
						<p>When on-site, technicians can trigger a background script on all machines to automatically install system updates and restart. This allows technicians to focus on other site tasks; they only have to verify maintenance has been completed rather than performing the maintenance tasks themselves.</p>
