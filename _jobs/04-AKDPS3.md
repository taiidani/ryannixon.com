title: Analyst/Programmer III at the Alaska Department of Public Safety, 2011 - 2013

Assigned as technical lead to the ARMS project, a records management system based off of the [Niche RMS](http://www.nicherms.com) being implemented to replace the paper-based incident tracking system currently in use. Set up the product infrastructure, XSLT-based reports and client deployment packages including in-house update functionality using a WCF web service and a C# background Windows service.

Also developed and supported a C# interface to synchronize person records from the Alaska Public Safety Information Network (APSIN) to the ARMS application.

Assisted with Niche Technology in developing the capability for their application to support Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) statistics that are submitted to the FBI on an annual basis for reporting. This involved the use of both T-SQL for working on the back-end report and a Python/HTML/JavaScript solution to provide a human readable interface for the statistics.
