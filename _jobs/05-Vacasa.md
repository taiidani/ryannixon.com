#### As a DevOps Engineer

* Led the internal Vacasa "CLI-Utility" tool through multiple iterations and languages (PHP, Bash scripts, Golang).
* Architected the local development environment into a Docker-centric model, enabling pinned versions of software to match production.
* Designed and implemented a complete CI/CD pipeline using CircleCI, Docker Hub, and Jenkins. Deployments were managed through a Hubot application connected to Slack and gated using GitHub Pull Requests with a protected `master` branch.
* Integrated centralized monitoring systems into the entire stack using Datadog, Sumo Logic, and Sentry.
* Set up and managed a Docker Swarm Mode cluster in production, hosting multiple applications routed through a Traefik reverse proxy.
* Participated in converting the legacy monolithic PHP 5.6 codebase into a PHP 7.1 (and polyglot) microservices-based structure.

#### As an Engineer

* Implemented a new Edit Units page, converting the existing monolithic design into an MVC structure.
* Converted the administration backend to use an RBAC hierarchical permissions structure.
* Designed and implemented a ticket tracking system for internal IT and Maintenance tasks.
* Implemented and trained for the use of BDD testing using the Codeception PHP testing framework.
* After a gettext-style solution was declined, designed an in-house i18n translation system for localizing the public-facing website into various languages.
